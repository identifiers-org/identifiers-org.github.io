# Cloud Services

## Resolution

## Metadata

## Registry / Namespace

## Access to those Services

### libAPI

### OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications

### Cloud Web Frontend

#### Registry web

- Identification and reference to Identifiers.org registry's record of data collections is done via URL of the form:

    `https://identifiers.org/registry/[resource]`

    Example:

    `https://identifiers.org/registry/`

    Those should only be used to identify and retrieve metadata provided by the Registry or access information in RDF/XML. Those URIs should NOT be used for identifying data entries.
