# Resolving mechanisms
A central, curated registry stores the information necessary to resolve either Compact Identifier or URI forms of identifier, which are sent as queries to the Identifiers.org resolving system.

## Compact Identifier resolution
Identifiers.org is able to handle queries presented as Compact Identifiers (prefix:accession). A Compact Identifier is a unique string consisting of a **Prefix** (assigned by curator), a colon (‘:’), and a **Local identifier** (eg. accession number string). The **Prefix** is composed of an assigned **Namespace**, which may be preceded by a **Provider Code**, separated by a slash (‘/’).

Namespace Compact Identifier pattern:
```[namespace prefix]:[accession]``` eg: [pdb:2gc4](https://identifiers.org/pdb:2gc4).

Provider Compact Identifier pattern:
```[provider code]/[namespace prefix]:[accession]``` eg: [pdbe/pdb:2gc4](https://identifiers.org/pdbe/pdb:2gc4).

**We recommend using Compact Identifiers for annotation and citation, linked using identifiers.org URLs.**

## URI resolution
Identifiers.org provides direct access to the identified data using one selected physical location (or resource). Where multiple physical locations are recorded in the registry the most stable one is selected for resolution. This allows the location independent referencing (and resolution if required) of data records.

URI resolution pattern:
```http://identifiers.org/[namespace]/[entity]``` eg: http://identifiers.org/pdb/2gc4.
