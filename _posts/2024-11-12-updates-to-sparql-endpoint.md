Thanks to ELIXIR's BioHackathon 2024, we could use [project 13](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2024/blob/main/13.md) to improve our sparql endpoint with data from our registry. Special thank you to Jerven Bolleman and all the DBCLS team for all the help in this achievement and the ELIXIR BioHackathon organization team.

Registry data was modeled based on the DCAT and VoID RDF schemes in addition to additional terms for all registry data. You will find all the information that you need to use it in our [sparql documentation page](/pages/sparql)
