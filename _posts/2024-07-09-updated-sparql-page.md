# Updates to SPARQL documentation

After a long time of being out of date, the SPARQL documentation has been brought up to date.

The service has been up for a long time but the documentation was not usable. This has been corrected, please refer to [the new text](/pages/sparql) for examples on how it's supposed to be used.

If you use this service, [please get in touch](/pages/contact) to let us know how you are using it and how we can improve it for the community. We plan to work on it in the [ELIXIR BioHackathon 2024](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2024/blob/main/13.md) and community input would be greatly appreciated.
