  Use this file as template when creating a new update post. 
  Make sure this doesn't have a date in its filename, so it doesn't get listed in the compiled files.

  Make sure to prefix the new filename with date of the new post.
  Similarly to how the existing posts filenames are written. 
  Otherwise, it will be considered a draft and won't be compiled into a new post.

  Update posts must have the `updates` category in the front matter. 
  This is used in the liquid templates for the [updates page](/pages/updates.md) and for the [latest update JSON file](/latest-update.json).
  The `title` and `description` in the front matter above are used in the same files.

  Replace all this text (except front matter) with the actual contents of the post.
