title: [Identifiers.org]
description: Identifiers.org is an established resolving system that enables the referencing of data for the scientific community, with a current focus on the Life Sciences domain. It handles persistent identifiers in the form of URIs and CURIEs. This allows the referencing of data in both a location-independent and resource-dependent manner. The provision of resolvable identifiers (URLs) fits well with the Semantic Web vision, and the Linked Data initiative.
