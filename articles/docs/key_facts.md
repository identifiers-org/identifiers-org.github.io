# Key facts
* Resolvable identifiers: the system provides resolvable identifiers in the form of Compact Identifiers and URIs.
* Location independent: the system is able to decouple the identification of records from the physical locations on the web where they can be retrieved.
* Free to use: there is no cost involved to register or use the identifiers or this facility.
* Granularity of identifiers: identifiers available at multiple levels (data collections, resources and data entities).
* Customisable behaviours: the URI system can be tailored to needs in terms of formats available and preferred resolving locations.
* RDF support: responses encoded in RDF/XML are provided via content negotiation, other formats are being added.
* Community driven: we rely upon the community to drive and direct development, as well as to contribute new data collections.
* Curated resource: dedicated curators and community feedback ensure that information in the Registry remains up-to-date and accurate.
* Reliable: there is an automated link monitoring system that checks registered resources daily.
* Unrestricted scope: currently focused on Life Sciences, but the scope is potentially unlimited (community feedback dependent).
